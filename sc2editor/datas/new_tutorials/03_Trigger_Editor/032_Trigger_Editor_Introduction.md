# Trigger Editor Introduction

The Trigger Editor is where you'll build the logic underpinning your project. Triggers are what will turn your Editor project into an interactive, playable map. You can use this system to build games with plain-language elements, meaning you won't need to use a programming language. Using the Editor's pre-built library of these elements lets developers work quickly and easily when making games.

Acclaimed for its intuitive, visual approach to programming, the trigger system has been a long-standing favorite of amateurs and professionals throughout the history of Blizzard RTS games. As a tool, triggering can grow with its user, allowing them to eventually delve into programming by investigating Galaxy Script, the language that works behind the scenes of the system. Advanced use is supported through the Editor's extensive feature set, including a profiler for use in debugging and performance tuning.
