# Text Tags

Text Tags display text in game space, rather than in screen space like any interface or dialog options for text. They've been designed with a visual property that hangs them on top of a target unit and reacts to camera movements. This ensures that they're seated in the environment. As a result, they are often used in text elements that are halfway between being interface elements and gameplay elements. Notable applications of text tags include overhead player names, location names, and damage numbers.

## Text Tag Actions

You can access the text tag actions during action creation by navigating to the 'Text Tags' label.

These actions are broken down in the following table.

| Action                               | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Using Text Tags

Like dialogs, text tags are often reoriented, moved, and resized after creation. To support this, you should give each tag a persistent handle using a Set Variable action and the text tag function identifier Last Created Text Tag.

Take a look at the sequence of text tag actions below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Melee Initialization**
- **Events**  
  - Game - Map initialization

- **Local Variables**  
  (None shown)

- **Conditions**  
  (None shown)

- **Actions**
  - Text Tag - Create a text tag with the text \"Demo Text Tag\" for (All players), using a font size of 24, at (Position of Marine [60.29, 64.79]) and height offset 1.0, initially Visible, and fog of war enforcement set to False
  - Text Tag - Attach (Last created text tag) to Marine [60.29, 64.79] with height offset 1.0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this sequence, a text tag has been created with a Create Text Tag action. The action determines the tag's Text and Font Size, then sets the tag to the Position of a marine at a Height Offset. Following that, the tag is grafted to the marine with the Attach Text Tag To Unit action, targeting the Unit at a Height Offset. This pair of actions is a standard when using text tags. You should also note that the attachment has overwritten the tag position and will cause the text tag to move alongside its host unit.
