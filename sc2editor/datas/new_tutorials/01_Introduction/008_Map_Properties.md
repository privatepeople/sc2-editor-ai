# Map Properties

Map Properties affect a wide range of settings, determining everything from how your game lobby is handled on Battle.net to how the 'Fog of War' behaves. You can navigate to the collected map properties via Map ▶︎ Map Info, from any of the Editor modules.

Note that 'Map Properties' actually refers to a grouping of eight tabs of options that govern high-level map decisions. Accessing any of the eight headings under the Map tab will direct you to the same 'Map Properties' window. These tabs are broken down in the following sections.

## Map Info

The Map Info properties determine logistical details about a map.

<tr class="odd">
<td>Name</td>
<td>The map name, displayed to locations such as Battle.net, the Arcade, and the publishing screens.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Suggested Players</td>
<td>An internal note for how many players the map could require. This is unrelated to the Suggested Players value found in 'Game Info' and 'Map Info' screens in the custom games section and the Arcade respectively. That value is automatically generated from lobby info.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Description</td>
<td>An area for describing the map's contents. This section is also often used for author credits or any other type of general message that could be of interest to an audience.</td>

<td>It may be set as a Map Image, Custom Image, or Hidden. The last option results in no image appearing in any of the contexts listed above.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Game Minimap Image</td>
<td>Determines what image the minimap will use. Options include a Map Image, or a Custom Image. Traditionally a Map Image is expected, but the option is provided for non-traditional games.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Minimap Resolution</td>
<td>Determines minimap quality level as follows: Normal: 256 x 248, High: 512 x 496, Ultra: 1024 x 992.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Locale</td>
<td>Selects the locale version for the inputted information. You will also notice a 'Copy to All Locales' button, which will move the information from the current view to all other existing locales.</td>

## Map Options

The Map Options are a collection of gameplay and visual oriented options for altering the game. There are also some logistical options here that can affect decisions made during map creation.

Automatically Add Multiplayer Data allows the Melee/Custom Map to add the needed multiplayer dependencies at game launch. Hide Battle.net Lobby will allow Arcade Map users to minimize the lobby while waiting for a game to start. |

## Map Bounds

The Map Bounds allow for dynamic alteration of the size limitation of both the playable area and the camera area within the map. The arrow buttons found on each side of the map allow for resizing along their specific axes.

| Property               | Details                                                                                           |

## Map Symmetry

Map Symmetry is used to set the symmetry controls within the map. This is useful in terrain generation for melee maps, where symmetry is often a necessary feature for competitive play.

## Map Textures

Each map uses a specific Texture Set type, which is a palette of eight textures used to paint the ground on the map. You can select these palettes for use in the Map Textures tab. Note that cliff styles are also a part of this palette and may be configured here.

## Map Tags

Map Tags are used to create Difficulty Tags for organizing terrain objects, such as Units, Doodads, Regions and Points, allowing you to filter them for later viewing.

## Map Loading Screen

The Map Loading Screen tab allows you to configure the introductory screen shown to players while the map is loading.
