# Player Properties

Player Properties is where you'll find many essential options for settings up your game. You can find them by navigating to Map ▶︎ Player Properties from any module of the Editor.

## Player Property Fields

Player Properties addresses questions of control, start location, race, and color. In that regard, it is similar to the typical Battle.net lobby. Changing these properties will influence how the game lobby appears when playing online. However, these options extend further, as they also control global properties relevant to non-traditional games.

The following table details the options in Player Properties, along with a description of each.

| Action           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \#               | A number used for ordering and referencing players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Name             | A multipurpose ID. This is typically displayed when highlighting a unit owned by the named player, but it can be used in other capacities. In online games, the player's Battle.net ID is always displayed as the Name property. Names are not displayed for units owned by Hostile or Neutral controlled players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Color            | Determines a player's team color. If set, this is unchangeable in the game lobby. Unlike melee play, multiple players can be assigned the same team color. There are 16 color options in total, setting (Any) will allow players to choose their color from a lobby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Race             | Determines a player's race from the options Protoss, Terran, Zerg, Neutral, or (Any). Selecting Neutral will set a player's race to random, while setting (Any) will allow the player to choose their race from the lobby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Control          | Determines the controller for each player slot. User creates a slot for human players, adding an open slot in the game's lobby that can be filled with either a human player or an AI controlled computer. None sets a player slot to no player. This is the default value. Computer creates a player to be controlled by the game's default AI. Neutral creates a computer-controlled player that has a Neutral Alliance setting with all other players. Hostile creates a computer controlled player that has an Enemy Alliance setting with all other players. |
| Start Location   | Determines where the default units are created via the 'Create Melee Starting Units For Each Player' action. In all other map types, this controls the starting location of a player's camera, unless otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Decal            | Sets the default decal used for any of a player's units that support decals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Default Observed | Determines the camera settings of Observer players when no specific player's vision is being viewed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note that, while there are 16 player slots, StarCraft II supports a maximum of 15 human players. At least one slot must be set to Neutral, Hostile, or None. This includes players observing an online match.

## Customizing Players

In melee maps, player properties alone can be used to customize scenarios.
