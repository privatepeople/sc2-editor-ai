# Getting to the Editor

The Editor is bundled with all editions of StarCraft II, including Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, and Legacy of the Void. It is also included with the free StarCraft II Starter Edition. 

Once you have downloaded the client, you can access the Editor through the Battle.net launcher.

You'll find the 'Launch Editor' button just below the header link in the launcher.

You can also find the Editor linked locally, both in the StarCraft install folder and any Start Menu links.

You'll also find that opening any native .SC2Map files will launch the editor.

You'll also find a tab on the left side of the StarCraft II login screen with a link titled, 'Open Editor'.

Once you've launched it, the Editor will display its start-up screen while it loads. Depending on your game settings and the default map set to load, this may take some time.
